# Destiny 2's Spicy Ramen Shop Site

### Task

Build a simple restaurant site with a home page, menu, and contact page. The page will dynamically render the portions of the app that is being viewed by the user. Use Webpack to compile the code into one bundle.

### Description

I decided to use one of my favorite game series as inspiration for this task. In the Destiny universe, the Spicy Ramen Shop can be found throughout the main social hub called the Last City. The restaurant also plays a small part in the lore for some of the characters in the game.
