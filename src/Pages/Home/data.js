Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of info provided on what this restaurant actually does in the Destiny universe. We know that Cayde-6 loved it and you can see some locations in the social hubs of the game. Bungie even release a cookbook with the Spicy Ramen recipe in it!

I decided to check the place out anyway and was very happy with what I received. Quick service and great food! The location in the Bazaar even has a nice little memorial to our old buddy Cayde too. It's a nice touch.",
